To add call system to xv6, we must go through the following steps:
1. We must add the function name to h.syscall.
2. Next, we must add the prototype in h.defs.
3.h.user, we must act as above.
4.c.sysproc In this function, we must retrun our main function.
5. Now we have to give this func to S.user.
6. Now we need to add our main function that wants to print the processes here, since a strct is needed
To make it, we need to add this struct in h.proc and by making a list of this info_proc in c.proc, we can get data
Take the necessary from ptable and print it using cptable. We have given the name of this function run.
7. Now we have to check this call system, for this we have to create a file for ourselves to give the desired output.
We have to make several children using fork and call the parent system call.
8. Then we need to add this file to the makefile.
9. Then we have to run this file in the operating system.
which gives us output like this:
